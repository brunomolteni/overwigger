# overwigger
Multi-Device Touch Controller for Bitwig Studio


## Setup

- Go inside the folder "Controller_Scripts" and copy the folder called "Overwigger" into your bitwig controller scripts folder
- Open Bitwig and add this new controller script, make sure that it's turned on
- Download the binaries for your OS from [the latest release](https://github.com/brunomolteni/overwigger/releases)
- Unzip the binaries, go into the resulting folder and run the app called "overwigger", it may take some time to open and load completely
- if you dont see any color ( just dark gray boxes ) then it's not connecting with Bitwig, make sure the first 2 steps are done correctly
- if you want to connect with a phone or tablet, make sure to be connected to the same wifi as your pc, and right click anywhere in the app window, you are gonna get an alert giving you an IP address that you need to browse to on your mobile device.
